This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Chapter 13   
Relational Data  

13.1
multiple tables of data are called relational data because it is the relations, not just the individual datasets, that are important.

Mutating joins, which add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another  
Filtering joins, which filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.  
Set operations, which treat observations as if they were set elements.  

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```
```{r}
airlines
airports 
planes
weather
```
To connect each plane to its origin you would need to combine the flights and airports tables.  
If weather was included with all aiports, it would show weather info at departing and arriving aiports of a flight.   
You could add "special" days as a column of holidays and have a holidays table in the data.  

13.3

A key is a variable (or set of variables) that uniquely identifies an observation  
- these connect tables  

A primary key uniquely identifies an observation in its own table.  
A foreign key uniquely identifies an observation in another table.  

Surrogate key is one that can be added if primary key is missing.  

13.4

A mutating join allows you to combine variables from two tables.

```{r}
flights2 <- flights %>% 
  select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)
flights2
```

```{r}
flights2 %>%
  select(-origin, -dest) %>% 
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier")
```
 An inner join matches pairs of observations whenever their keys are equal.  
 An outer join keeps observations that appear in at least one of the tables.  
 
```{r}
flights2 %>% 
  left_join(weather)
```
```{r}
flights2 %>% 
  left_join(planes, by = "tailnum")
```
 
```{r}
airports %>%
  semi_join(flights, c("faa" = "dest")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
    borders("state") +
    geom_point() +
    coord_quickmap()


```
```{r}
flights %>%
  filter(is.na(tailnum), !is.na(arr_time)) %>%
  nrow()
```

Flights with bo tail number means that that flight was cancelled. 

```{r}

```

13.7
Set operations work with a complete row, comparing the values of every variable.
